            "Sales conversations are rich. Memory fades. CRMs lose context. We bridge that gap.",
        story: `After spending 15 years leading sales teams at enterprise software companies, I experienced firsthand the chaos of trade shows and field sales. I watched talented sales professionals lose valuable context, struggle with manual data entry, and miss follow-up opportunities—not because they weren't good at their jobs, but because the tools didn't match the reality of how sales actually happens.

At a particularly chaotic tech conference in 2021, I found myself frantically typing notes on my phone between conversations, only to realize hours later that I couldn't remember which insights belonged to which prospect. That moment of frustration became the genesis of LeadPulze.

We built LeadPulze because we believe sales professionals deserve tools that work in the real world—noisy exhibition halls, busy trade show floors, and fast-paced field environments. Tools that capture the richness of human conversation without the administrative burden that kills momentum.`,
